The {TOOL_NAME} has several limitations: 
1) Requires valid URLs that are accessible and contain text content. 
2) May not work with JavaScript-heavy websites or those requiring authentication. 
3) Performance depends on the quality and relevance of the website content. 
4) May return incomplete or inaccurate information if the website content is not comprehensive. 
5) Limited by the chunking and embedding process which may miss context. 
6) Requires OpenAI (or Together) API access for embeddings and LLM generation.
"""

BEST_PRACTICE = f"""
For optimal results with the {TOOL_NAME}:
1) Use specific, targeted queries rather than broad questions.
2) Ensure the URL is accessible and contains relevant information.
3) Prefer websites with well-structured, text-rich content.
4) For complex queries, break them down into smaller, specific questions.
5) Verify important information from multiple sources when possible.
6) Use it as part of a multi-step research process rather than a single source of truth.
7) It is highly recommended to use this tool after calling other web-based tools (e.g., Google_Search_Tool, Wiki_Search_Tool, etc.) to get the real, accessible URLs.

SUMMARIZE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert AI assistant. Your task is to provide a clear, concise, and accurate answer to the user's query based **exclusively** on the provided reference information.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1.  **Analyze the Query:** First, fully understand the user's query and identify the specific information being asked for.
2.  **Scan for Relevance:** Read through each numbered chunk in the reference information. Identify all chunks that contain information directly relevant to answering the query. A simple keyword match is not sufficient; the chunk must contain a substantive fact that helps answer the question.
3.  **Extract Key Facts & Synthesize:** From the relevant chunks, extract only the key facts and figures needed. Synthesize these extracted facts into a comprehensive, single-paragraph answer. Write the answer in your own words. **Do not** copy entire chunks.

## Output Format and Example

**IMPORTANT:** You must follow this format exactly.

### Example Input
- **User Query:** What were the key financial results for Q4 2023?
- **Reference Information:**
[1] The company's new "Project Starlight" initiative launched in January 2024.
[2] In Q4 2023, the company reported a total revenue of $5.2 million and a net profit of $800,000. This was a 15% increase in revenue compared to Q3 2023.
[3] Marketing spend in Q4 2023 was focused on digital channels, totaling $450,000.
[4] The CEO stated that the strong Q4 performance was driven by robust sales in the North American market.

### Example Output
Answer:
In the fourth quarter of 2023, the company achieved a total revenue of $5.2 million, which represented a 15% increase from the previous quarter, and a net profit of $800,000. The strong performance was attributed to robust sales in the North American market. The marketing expenditure for this period was $450,000.
